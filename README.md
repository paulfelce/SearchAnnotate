Annotate Google Search results

This is a personal project to help me when researching a topic.
I often find I can't remember what info is in a search result so have to click into it.
this summarises my findings on the search page , making research more efficient.

AI tools probably make this redundant, but it's handy for me. And I hope it's useful to you too.
